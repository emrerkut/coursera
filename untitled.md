## Arithmetic Expression Examples
The following code cells demonstrate basic arithmetic operations.
# Multiplication of numbers
x = 5
y = 6
z = x * y
# Addition of numbers
a = 10
b = 20
c = a + b
print(c)

print(z)
# Converting minutes to hours
minutes = 150
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)
# Converting minutes to hours
minutes = 150
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)
